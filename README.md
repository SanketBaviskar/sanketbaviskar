# Backend & Infrastructure Software Engineer 👋

🔗 Portfolio: [https://sanket-portfolio-phi.vercel.app/](https://sanket-portfolio-phi.vercel.app/)

Hi, I’m **Sanket Baviskar** a **Backend & Infrastructure Software Engineer** with **2+ years of experience** building **scalable, fault-tolerant backend services and distributed systems**.

I specialize in designing and operating **cloud-native APIs, data pipelines, and infrastructure services** that are reliable under load and easy for developers to build on. I’ve worked in fast-paced product environments, owning systems **end-to-end** from architecture and implementation to deployment, monitoring, and iteration.

## 🔧 What I Build

I enjoy working on **backend systems where correctness, performance, and reliability matter**:

* **Distributed backend services** (stateless APIs, async workers, control planes)
* **High-throughput APIs** with rate limiting, caching, and request orchestration
* **Cloud-native infrastructure** using containers, CI/CD, and managed services
* **Data-intensive systems** (event ingestion, pipelines, vector search)
* **Observability & reliability** (metrics, logging, SLO-driven design)

---

## 🏗️ Technical Focus Areas

* **Backend & Systems**

  * REST / gRPC API design
  * Concurrency, async processing, and backpressure
  * Caching strategies and performance tuning (p95 / p99)
  * Multi-tenant architectures and data isolation

* **Distributed Systems**

  * Fault tolerance and graceful degradation
  * Idempotency, retries, and consistency trade-offs
  * Rate limiting, quotas, and traffic shaping
  * Event-driven and message-based architectures

* **Cloud & Infrastructure**

  * Containerized services (Docker)
  * CI/CD pipelines
  * AWS-based deployments
  * Production readiness and scalability considerations

---

## 🚀 Selected Projects

* **Multi-Tenant AI Knowledge Platform (RAG)**
  Designed and built a backend platform supporting document ingestion, vector search, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), with tenant-scoped data isolation and scalable API services.

* **Distributed Rate Limiting Service**
  Implemented multiple industry-standard rate limiting algorithms (Token Bucket, Sliding Window, Fixed Window) using Redis for distributed state coordination, optimized for high-throughput traffic.

## 🎯 What I’m Looking For

I’m actively seeking **Backend / Platform / Infrastructure Software Engineer (SDE)** roles where I can:

* Build and scale **core backend services**
* Work on **distributed systems and infrastructure**
* Solve reliability, performance, and scalability problems at real-world scale
