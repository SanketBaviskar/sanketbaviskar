I'm **Sanket Baviskar**, a **Backend & Distributed Systems Engineer** with 2+ years of experience building scalable, fault-tolerant services and data-driven APIs. I’ve worked in fast-moving product environments, owning features end-to-end from design to deployment, and I’m currently pursuing my **MS in Computer Science at CU Denver**.

I love working on:
- High-performance **APIs**, rate limiting, and request orchestration  
- **Distributed systems**, caching, and observability  
- **Cloud-native** architectures on AWS with CI/CD and containers  
- Secure, reliable **infrastructure** that developers can trust at scale  

I’m actively looking for **Backend / Platform / Infrastructure SDE roles**.
